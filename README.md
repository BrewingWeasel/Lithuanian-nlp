# Lithuanian-nlp

A python tool to conjugate and info about verbs (see example.py)

verb data (data.txt) from verbalyser by ror-expert (https://github.com/ror-expert/verbalyser)

Future plans:
- ~~support reflexive verbs~~
- ~~support lemmatization of verbs with prefixes~~
- support ~~nouns~~ (partially completed) and adjectives
- support prepositions
- support detection of word type
- add more features :)


(this is my first github project)
